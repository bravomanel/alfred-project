            <ol>
               <li>
                  Put arround 2g of butter for each egg in the pan while it's
                  still cold
               </li>
               <li>
                  Turn on the heat on the lowest option and wait for the butter
                  to melt completelly, try not to get the pan too hot
               </li>
               <li>
                  If you want a more presentable eggs, you should add the salt
                  and pepper below the eggs
               </li>
               <li>Add the Eggs with care to not break the Yolk</li>
               <li>
                  Don't touch the egg until there's a layer of white totally
                  cooked, after this, check if the eggs is not stick
               </li>
               <li>
                  If the egg is sticked, try to loosen it by the sides first,
                  then the yolk
               </li>
               <li>
                  The perfect fried egg is when the white is almost totally
                  cooked, but the yolk is still liquid
               </li>
            </ol>
